# Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a Spam Mail Detection system using Machine Learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to classify emails as either spam or not spam (also known as "ham") based on their content. By analyzing the characteristics of email messages, the model is able to identify patterns commonly associated with spam emails, helping users to filter out unwanted emails automatically.
